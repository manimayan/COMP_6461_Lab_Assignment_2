Lab Assignment # 2 

Introduction 
In this assignment, a simple HTTP server application has been implemented and used it with off-the-shelf HTTP clients (including httpc client, the result of Assignment #1).  Precisely, we aim to build a simple remote file manager on top of the HTTP protocol in the server side. 

Outline 
The following is a summary of the main tasks of the Assignment: 
1. Study-Review HTTP network protocol specifications (Server Side). 
2. Build your HTTP server library that implements the basic specifications. 
3. Develop a minimal file server on top of the HTTP server library. 
4. (optional) Enhance the file server application to support simultaneous multi-requests. 
5. (optional) Implement the support for Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers.
